## More than a Grammatical Error Corrector
GECko+ is an English language assisting tool that corrects mistakes of various types on written texts. 
While many well-settled pieces of software of its kind correct mistakes at the grammatical level (orthography and syntax), our novel pipeline allows the tool to perform corrections both at **grammatical** and at **discourse** level.

## Running locally and developing
### Option 1 - Using a virtual environment
1. Clone the repository.
1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.7.
1. Install the requirements files `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
1. Download the models by executing:
    * `mkdir -p /application/models/gector/data/model_files && cd application/models/gector/data/model_files && curl -O https://grammarly-nlp-data-public.s3.amazonaws.com/gector/xlnet_0_gector.th`.
    * `mkdir -p /application/models/sentence_reorder cd /application/models/sentence_reorder && curl -O http://tts.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sentence_order/nips_bert.tar && tar -xf nips_bert.tar && rm nips_bert.tar && mv nips_bert/ model/`.

1. Run the web app locally by executing `run.py`. The default development URL is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Option 2 - Using Docker
1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t gecko-app .`.
2. Run the image: `docker run -d -p 3000:80 gecko-app`. The URL will be `http://localhost:3000/`.
